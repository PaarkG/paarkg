            <p>
                Welcome! My name is <strong>Kevin</strong> and I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student working on this 
                website to learn some basic web development. <br><br>
                This website will be a big of an autobiography, and the home page will contain my experiments with web development 
                as I try working with styling, JS, etc. For now, it will just be blank, as that is all still to come.
