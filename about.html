                    Welcome! My name is <strong>Kevin</strong> and I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student working on this 
                    website to learn some basic web development. <br><br>
                    This website will be a bit of an autobiography, and the home page will contain my experiments with web development 
                    as I try working with styling, JS, etc. For now, it will just be blank, as that is all still to come.

            <div class="textWithImageContainer">
            <p>
                I started getting into Computer Science when I got my first laptop and started playing video games with 
                <strong>Hot Wheels</strong> and made my way to <strong>Roblox</strong>. I started attempting to develop <strong>Discord</strong> bots 
                and <strong>Roblox</strong> games when I was 12. Since then I've taken lots of CS courses including AP CS A in highschool.<br><br>
                I'm currently studying CS at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, considering a BS/MS in 4 years or a Robotics Engineering
                double major. In highschool I was the primary programmer for my robotics team for 3 years, and it definitely inspired 
                me to pursue a career in what I call <em>real</em> programming, which is ironic for me to say while programming a website, 
                since I always considered web design to be my last choice for career.
